# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Description

An ask_for_input function uses Python's input function to receive a user's guess. It checks the validity of the guess by checking: 

1) That the guess is one-character long
1) That the guess is a letter (using Python's isalpha method)

A function called check_guess then checks whether or not that letter is contained in the chosen word.
